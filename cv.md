## About me
 I was just another student at BSUIR when I first started learning about web-development. Since then, I grew to love this ever-changing and diverse world of frameworks, languages and, of course, opportunities. 
 
 My technical background and desire to learn provided me enough momentum to learn a lot by myself, but I feel that right now, I might greatly benefit from gaining more practical experience.
 A year ago, I worked on an open source project as a frontend developer for 3 months. There I learned a lot of problem-solving skills as well as gained great respect for all open source/non-commercial products and for the inspired people working on them.
 
 Right now I'm working as a design engineer in a R&D bureau, designing advanced printed circuit board for high-precision measuring devises, but I decided to change my field of work in a next year or two. My current work requires a lot of concentration and an ability to multi-task, since you need to consider many factors while designing a circuit board and even one mistake  can lead to a whole devise working incorrectly.
 
 I hope my abilities, knowledge and desire to learn will help me find new employment opportunities in the future.
